For compiled binary, please go to [Releases](https://github.com/SLINGhub/RFkit/releases/tag/RF) page. 

RFkit is a freely distributed software package for processing targeted metabolomics data from RapidFire-MS data. The tool takes the following data as input: (i) mzML files containing the data for individual plates, (ii) transition-level information and (iii) a batch log file containing sipping time information. The package automatically splices the data into individual injections and reports the total ion intensities of the transitions integrated over the injection time, with edges trimmed to yield expected peak shapes. The tool is provided as binary executables for Windows and Mac OS X (Apple Silicon).
